// Package fabricidentity allocates the identity the fabric knows a network by.
//
// The platform's address service allocates prefixes, not integers. Rather than
// build a second allocator with the same uniqueness and concurrency problems
// already solved there, an identity is allocated as a block from a pool that is
// never routed, and the integer is the block's index within that pool. A /32
// root handing out /64s yields exactly 2^32 allocations whose distinguishing
// bits are exactly the 32 the fabric uses.
//
// That buys uniqueness, exhaustion accounting, quota and an audit trail, and
// costs address space that is never routed and never reachable.
